# Testcases_Automation


* This project focuses on the development of automated test cases for seven distinct programs implemented in C++, Java, and Python programming languages. Automated testing ensures that the functionality of the programs is accurate, reliable, and consistent across different languages. The test cases cover a range of scenarios to validate the correctness of the programs under various conditions
